<h1>Articles</h1>

<ul>
    <% @articles.each do |article| %>
        <li>
            <%= link_to article.title, article %>
        </li>
    <% end %>
</ul>

<%# The resources method also sets up URL and path helper methods that we can use to keep our code 
from depending on a specific route configuration. The values in the "Prefix" column above plus 
a suffix of _url or _path form the names of these helpers. For example, the article_path helper 
returns "/articles/#{article.id}" when given an article. However, we will take this one step 
further by using the link_to helper. The link_to helper renders a link with its first argument 
as the link's text and its second argument as the link's destination. If we pass a model object 
as the second argument, link_to will call the appropriate path helper to convert the object to a path. 
For example, if we pass an article, link_to will call article_path.%>
